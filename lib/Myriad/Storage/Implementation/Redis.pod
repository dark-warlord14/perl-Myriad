=head1 NAME

Myriad::Storage::Implementation::Redis - access to microservice storage via Redis

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides an implementation of L<Myriad::Role::Storage> using L<https://redis.io>
as the underlying storage mechanism and transport layer.

See L<Myriad::Role::Storage> for API details.

=head2 apply_prefix

Add the storage prefix to the key before sending it to Redis

=head2 get

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$k> - the relative key in storage

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to the corresponding value, or C<undef> if none.

=head2 set

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$k> - the relative key in storage

=item * C<$v> - the scalar value to set

=back

Note that references are currently B<not> supported - attempts to write an arrayref, hashref
or object will fail.

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve on completion.

=head2 getset

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$k> - the relative key in storage

=item * C<$v> - the scalar value to set

=back

Note that references are currently B<not> supported - attempts to write an arrayref, hashref
or object will fail.

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to the original value on completion.

=head2 incr

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$k> - the relative key in storage

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to the corresponding incremented value, or C<undef> if none.

=head2 observe

Observe a specific key.

Returns a L<Ryu::Source> which will emit the current and all subsequent values.

=head2 observe_namespace

Observe and entire namespace.

=head2 push

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$k> - the relative key in storage

=item * C<$v> - the scalar value to set

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to .

=head2 unshift

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to .

=head2 pop

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to .

=head2 shift

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to .

=head2 hash_set

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to .

=head2 hash_get

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to the scalar value for this key.

=head2 hash_add

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> indicating success or failure.

=head2 hash_keys

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to a list of the keys in no defined order.

=head2 hash_values

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to a list of the values in no defined order.

=head2 hash_exists

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to true if the key exists in this hash.

=head2 hash_count

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to the count of the keys in this hash.

=head2 hash_as_list

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item *

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to a list of key/value pairs,
suitable for assigning to a hash.

=head2 orderedset_add

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$k> - the relative key in storage

=item * C<$s> - the scalar score to be attached to member

=item * C<$m> - the scalar member value

=back

Note that references are B<not> supported - attempts to write an arrayref, hashref
or object will fail.

Redis sorted sets data structure family.
add a scored member value to a storage key

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve on completion.

=head2 orderedset_remove_member

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$k> - the relative key in storage

=item * C<$m> - the scalar member value

=back

Redis sorted sets data structure family.
removes a specific member from ordered set in storage

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve on completion.

=head2 orderedset_remove_byscore

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$min> - the minimum score

=item * C<$max> - the max score

=back

Redis sorted sets data structure family.
removes all members with scores between minimum and maximum within an ordered set in storage

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve on completion.

=head2 orderedset_member_count

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$k> - the relative key in storage

=item * C<$min> - the minimum score

=item * C<$max> - the max score

=back

Redis sorted sets data structure family.
gives the members count within the provided min and max scores in an ordered set.

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve on completion.

=item * C<$with_score> - flag to return members with or without scores

=back

Redis sorted sets data structure family.
gives list of members within the provided min and max scores in an ordered set.

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve on completion.
