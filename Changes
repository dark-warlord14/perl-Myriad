Revision history for Myriad

0.002     2021-04-24 16:36:44+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    [API Changes]
    - The "perl" transport has been renamed to "memory", for consistency
      with implementations in other languages
    - Startup and shutdown calls now receive the `$myriad` instance as the
      first parameter for convenience, and can be method calls (e.g. Myriad.pm
      method name) instead of plain coderefs

    [New features]
    - Subscription to configuration changes via the Redis transport - configuration
      objects still use Ryu::Observable so this behaviour should be a seamless upgrade
      for existing code

    [Bugs fixed]
    - Batch handling had a memory leak, this version should be improved
      although `await` calls inside a batch method may still exhibit
      increased memory usage (we expect to address this in the next version)
